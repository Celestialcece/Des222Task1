        <p>"Imagine a person who was born in a cave, who spent their entire life living
            underground, their only source of illumination being candles and oil lamps. Imagine they’ve never been above ground, they don’t
            even know the surface exists. Then one day a cave-in happens in a side tunnel, and reveals an opening to the surface. Sunlight pours
            into the opening, and at rst it is blinding and the person runs away in fear. Later they return to the opening, and as the person’s
            eyes adjust they look out through the hole and see a bright and brilliant world full of colors they didn’t even know existed.</p>


            <p>That world is scary, it’s huge and full of unknowns, so they crawl back into the cave for safety, but that hole is still there, and they see
            the light every time they pass it. Gradually they peek out more and more frequently, and further and further from the opening. They
            start to want that light, they nd reasons to visit it more often.</p>


            <p>Eventually they realize that they don’t want to go back into the hole any more. They have to go back, because that is where their
            family and friends are, but this place is so much better, they want to stay here. Going back into the hole feels wrong, it starts to hurt
            to be in the dark so much."</p>
